# Objectives

The project aims to develop new methods for using video data generated during field ethological studies on birds.

The new methods will primarily use advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate a lot of manual work that goes into annotating video data.

- Infer the location of the bird in the frame.
- And time spent during each “feeder visit”
- Identify bands for each bird in a frame
- Stretch goal: Identify “interactions” or "dispacement events"
